Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This project is my first attempt at developing open world games. I created this prototype using Unity 2022.3.46f1 in order to explore open world mechanics and improve myself in this field. I got help from the [Unity 3D | Open-World Survival Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtLToKUhgzwnk4U2eQYridNnObc2gqWo-) playlist of the [Mike's Code](https://www.youtube.com/@Mikes-Code) Youtube Channel in the creation of this prototype.
