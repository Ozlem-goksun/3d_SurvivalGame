# First Steps for Open World Games üåç

Hey there! üëã
This project is my first attempt at developing open world games. I created this prototype using Unity 2022.3.46f1 in order to explore open world mechanics and improve myself in this field. I got help from the [Unity 3D | Open-World Survival Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtLToKUhgzwnk4U2eQYridNnObc2gqWo-) playlist of the [Mike's Code](https://www.youtube.com/@Mikes-Code) Youtube Channel in the creation of this prototype.

### <i>So if you're ready, let's get started!!!</i>

<p>First of all, let's add a character to our playing area and give it movement</p>
<p>As you can see below, our character can look 360 ¬∞ to the right and left, while he can look up and down within certain limits.We do this because we want a more realistic perspective.Of course, if you have the ability to look around by somersaulting, you can add a more free perspective to your character.</p>
